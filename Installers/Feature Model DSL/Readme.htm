	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>For installation of the Feature Modeling DSL simply double-click on the
	<b><i>FeatureModel</i></b><i><b>DSL.msi</b></i>,
		which you can find in the 
	current directory and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
	<h2>Getting started</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Install the Feature Modeling DSL.</li>
		<li>Open Visual Studio 2005.</li>
		<li>Open any existing or create a new project or solution.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Right click on a project in 
		the <i>Solution Explorer</i> and select <i>Add-&gt;New Item</i></li>
		<li>Select <i>Visual C# Project Items</i> and select the <i>
		FeatureModel</i> and fill in the name for the model you want to 
		create.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><img border="0" src="NewFeatureDiagram.PNG" width="681" height="419"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>After adding the new item an empty document will open and in the 
		Toolbox the concepts provided by the Feature Modeling DSL become 
		available</li>
	</ul>
	<p><img border="0" src="Toolbox.jpg" width="182" height="175"></p>
	<h2>Elements of a Feature Model</h2>
	<p>In order to create your feature model simply drag the elements from the 
	toolbox to the document. With a right click on the document surface you can 
	check the correctness of the diagram&nbsp; Errors will be shown in the 
	output window. Furthermore you can attach conditions, constraints and a 
	description to each feature by double clicking on the feature in the feature 
	model. Therefore we can create the requirements documents from the feature 
	model. Remember, requirements consists of capability, constraint and 
	condition.</p>
	<p>In addition you can generate an xml description from the model by right 
	click on the document surface. This xml description is intended to be the 
	input for the feature model configurator. </p>
	<p>The different elements are explained below.</p>
	<h3>Root Feature</h3>
	<p>In each feature model there is exactly one root feature that defines the 
	root node of the feature model.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="RootFeature.jpg" width="104" height="67"></p>
	<h3>Features</h3>
	<p>As mentioned earlier with a double click on the feature you can add 
	conditions, constraints and a descirption to each feature. In addition you 
	can choose the type of feature as either mendatory, optional or feature set 
	feature.</p>
	<h4>Mandatory Feature</h4>
	<p>Mandatory features are shown as features with a decorator that shows a 
	filled circle. These features are common to all products in the product 
	line.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="CommonFeature.jpg" width="79" height="54"></p>
	<h4>Optional Feature</h4>
	<p>Optional features are features that may or may not be part of a specific 
	product. In the model these features are shown with a white circle 
	decorator.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="OptionalFeature.jpg" width="79" height="56"></p>
	<h4>Feature Set</h4>
	<p>A feature set defines the minimum and maximum number of features that can 
	to be selected within this group of features. In the example below zero to 
	two features need to be selected for a valid model.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="FeatureSet.jpg" width="276" height="145"></p>
	<h3>Connectors</h3>
	<p>The table below shows the connections allowed for a feature model. This 
	is a directed graph where the left hand row is the source and the right hand 
	rows are the destinations for the connection.</p>
	<table border="1" width="51%" id="table1">
