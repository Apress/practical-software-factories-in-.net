<P>This document describes the content of the package that accompanies our book "<EM>Practical 
		Software Factories in .Net"</EM>. It contains parts of the Software 
	Factories case study that we conducted in course of writing. For a quick 
	overview, we structured this document by chapter, as it appears in the book.</P>
<h2>
	Current State</h2>
	This drop contains the three tools that we developed throughout the ISpySoft case study:
	<ul>
		<li>Feature Modeling DSL</li>
		<li>Software Factory Schema DSL</li>
		<li>Feature Model Configurator</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Because we decided to publish the ISpySoft Software Factory as a 
	community project on
	<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=ISpySoft">
	Codeplex</a> and it therefore becomes a moving target, we do not to include 
	it in this package. We rather refer you to the ISpySoft site at
	<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=ISpySoft">
	Codeplex</a> to download the latest bits from there. On the
	<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=ISpySoft">
	Codeplex</a> site you can find the prototypical ISpySoft application, guidance packages, 
	and the Software Factory template. Furthermore, in the future we will also update the DSLs to use the latest version of Microsoft DSL Tools.</p>
	<p>So stay tuned and also check out new information at <a href="http://www.ispysoft.net" target="_blank">www.ispysoft.net</a></p>
<h2>
	Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
	Each DSL comes with its own .MSI installer, which also contains the redistributable
	libraries for the DSL Toolkit. Therefore, if you only want to look at the models
	you will only need to install the corresponding DSLs.</p>
	<p>
		In case you would like to take a look a the meta-model and possibly make your own
		modifications, you will need the following prerequisites installed in order to be able to open
	and build the source code:</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Visual Studio 2005 SDK - V1 RTM October 2005</strong><br />
	(available from the <a href="http://affiliate.vsipmembers.com/affiliate/default.aspx">
		Visual Studio Industry Partner Affiliate</a> homepage)</p>
<p>
	<strong>Domain-Specific Language Toolkit</strong><br />
	(available from the<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/f/4/8f4a191f-329e-47b5-8fe7-9a26dca5113e/Microsoft%20DSL%20Tools%20-%20Nov2005CTP.zip">

<H2>Chapter 3</H2>
<H3>Feature Model DSL</H3>
<p>
	The Feature Model DSL allows for creating feature models as they are used to
	describe the commonalities and variabilities of a product line. The link below starts
	the installer that installs the Feature Model DSL into the Visual Studio 2005
	environment.</p>
<p>
	<a href="Installers\Feature Model DSL\FeatureModelDSL.msi" target="_blank">Feature Model DSL Installer (.msi)</a></p>
<H3>ISySoft Problem and Solution Feature Models</H3>
<p>
	The ISpySoft is contains two feature models; one for the problem domain of Private
	Eye Investigation, and one for the solution domain. The two links below open the
	feature models in Visual Studio 2005. Requirement is that the Feature Modeling DSL
	is correctly installed.</p>
	<p>

			Model (.featuremodel)</a><br />
		<a href="Models/Feature Models/" target="_blank">ISpySoft Solution Feature
			Model (.featuremodel)</a></p>
<H2>Chapter 5</H2>
<H3>Software Factory Schema DSL</H3>
<p>
	The Software Factory Schema DSL allows for creating Software Factory Schemas that
	are used to formally describe Software Factories. The link below starts the installer
	that installs the Software Factory Schema DSL into the Visual Studio 2005 environment.</p>
<p>
	<a href="Installers/Software Factory Schema DSL/SoftwareFactorySchemaDSL.msi" target="_blank">Software
		Factory Schema DSL Installer (.msi)</a></p>
<H3>ISySoft Software Factory Schema Project</H3>
<p>
	The link below opens a Visual Studio 2005 solution that contains the ISpySoft Software
	Factory schema. Furthermore this solution contains an instance of the Software Factory
	Schema Browser. Upon pressing F5, Visual Studio will open a Internet Explorer window
	with the ISpySoft Software Factory Schema Browser</p>

<h3>
	Feature Model Configurator</h3>
<p>
	The Feature Model Configurator is used during application development to select
	and deselect variabilities in feature models. These configurations can then be used
	e.g. by automated guidance steps to generate the appropriate code or configure components
	and services correctly.</p>
