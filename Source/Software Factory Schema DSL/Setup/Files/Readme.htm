	<h1><img src="ISpySoft.png" border=0 align="absMiddle" /> Software Factory Schema DSL</h1>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>For installation of the Software Factory Schema DSL simply double-click
	on the <i><b>SoftwareFactorySchemaDSL.msi</b></i>, which you can find in the 
	current directory and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
	<h2>Getting started</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Install the Software Factory Schema DSL.</li>
		<li>Open Visual Studio 2005.</li>
		<li>Select <i>New-&gt;Project.</i></li>
		<li>Under Visual C# category select the <i>SoftwareFactorySchemaProject</i> and 
		enter the Name for the language, the Location on the hard drive and the 
		Solution Name.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
        <img border="0" src="NewProject.jpg" width="681" height="495"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the solution explorer double click on the .sfschema file.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><img border="0" src="NewSchema.png" width="276" height="176"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>After opening the empty Software Factory Schema document the 
		Toolbox shows the concepts provided by the Software Factories Schema DSL</li>
	</ul>
	<p><img border="0" src="Toolbox.jpg" width="183" height="177"></p>
	<h2>Elements of a Software Factory Schema</h2>
	<p>In order to create your schema simply drag the elements from the toolbox 
	to the document. With a right click on the document surface you can check 
	the correctness of the diagram. Errors will be shown in the output window. 
	The different elements are explained below.</p>
	<h3>Viewpoints</h3>
	<p>You can add a new viewpoint from the <i>Toolbox</i> onto the schema 
	document.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="Viewpoint.jpg" width="113" height="95"></p>
	<p>With a right click on the viewpoint you can add a new Stakeholder and in 
	the <i>Properties Window </i>you can change the name to something 
	meaningful.</p>
	<h3>Artifacts</h3>
	<p>The different kinds of Artifacts (Tools, Work Products and Assets) added 
	to the schema by simply dragging and dropping an artifact onto the schema 
	surface. With a double click on the artifact you can change the name to 
	something more meaningful than the default name and you can select the type 
	of artifact from the selection menu.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="Artifacts.jpg" width="261" height="127"></p>
	<p>After selecting the artifact type the decorator in the shape will show 
	you what artifact type it is (A for asset, W for Work Product and T for 
	tool).</p>
	<h3>Activities and Mappings</h3>
	<p>The same way you added artifacts and viewpoints you can add activities 
	and mappings to the diagram.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="ActivityAndMapping.png" width="252" height="59"></p>
	<p>In the case of mappings you can double click on the shape and a dialog 
	opens that allows you to add a mapping description to the shape. This 
	description is currently only text but we can also think of scenarios where 
	this description is more formal and can be used to generate other output 
	like transformation scripts from it.</p>
	<h3>Connectors</h3>
	<p>Connections are implemented so only correct connections can be made. The 
	table below shows an overview of allowed connections. It is important to 
	mention that this is a directed graph. For the table this means that the 
	left hand column is the source of the connection and the right hand columns 
	the targets. Some connections are only allowed to be made in one pre-defined 
	direction. In some cases the tool will ask for additional information from 
	the user to make the connections valid (for example it will ask if the 
	connection is read or write connection).</p>

		<p>
			In order to open the Software Factory Schema Browser you will need to execute the
			following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Save the Software Factory schema model.</li>
			<li>In Solution Explorer right-click <em>SoftwareFactorySchemaBrowser.t4</em> and choose
				<em>Run Custom Tool</em>. This will regenerate <em>SoftwareFactorySchemaBrowser.xml</em>,
				which is a child of its T4 template. Alternatively you can use the <em>Transform All
					Templates</em> feature, which is accessible through a toolbar button in Solution
				Explorer.</li><li>Press F5 to start the project. Visual Studio will open Internet Explorer
	  with the Software Factory Schema Browser loaded. Note that the XML file references
	  a stylesheet, which provides the correct HTML formatting.</li></ol>
